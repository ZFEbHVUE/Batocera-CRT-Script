## 🖥️ CRT Setup Script Overview

This Bash script enables **true CRT support** in **Batocera**, including 15kHz, 25kHz, and 31kHz video output.  
Batocera does not natively support CRT displays — this script adds the full support needed for proper signal generation and resolution switching.

---

### ✅ Key Features
- 🕹️ **RetroArch** (Libretro cores) and **GroovyMAME** are preconfigured to use the **Switchres API** for automatic resolution switching.

- 🔁 **Modeline Switching**  
  Fully integrates the [Switchres tool](https://github.com/antonioginer/switchres/blob/master/README.md) (not the API) to handle resolution switching — *bypassing xrandr*.

- 🧠 **EDID & APU Detection**  
  - Automatically detects **AMD APUs** when using the **CableDeconn DP2VGA** (listed on the [Batocera Wiki](https://wiki.batocera.org/batocera-and-crt#displayport_to_vga_dac)).
  - Generates a **custom EDID** based on your selected monitor profile.

- 📁 **videomodes.conf Integration**  
  Resolutions are read from `videomodes.conf`, but **Switchres handles switching**, not xrandr.  
  You may manually add resolutions, but be sure to test them with your monitor profile first.

---

### ⚠️ Note on 320×240 Boot Resolution

`320x240p` as a **boot resolution** is *not officially supported*,  
as **EmulationStation themes do not currently support it** in Batocera.

---

### 🖼️ Monitor Profiles & Preconfigured Resolutions

- Comes with **29 pre-configured monitor profiles** supported by Switchres.
- Each profile includes **50+ hand-picked resolutions**, optimized for:

  - 🎮 Standalone Emulators (e.g., PCSX2, Dolphin)
  - 🐧 Native Linux Games
  - 📦 Non-Libretro Ports
  - 🍷 Wine, Flatpak & Steam Games

> 🕹️ **RetroArch** (Libretro cores) and **GroovyMAME** are preconfigured to use the **Switchres API** for automatic resolution switching.

## ❗ GPU Compatibility for CRT Output (15kHz)

Batocera's CRT output depends heavily on the GPU and driver capabilities. Here's what works — and what doesn’t — for 15.7 kHz (240p/480i) video signals.

---

### ✅ AMD GPUs – **Recommended**

Batocera includes the [15kHz kernel patchset](https://github.com/D0023R/linux_kernel_15khz), which enables full support for:

- Low-resolution video modes (e.g. 320×240, 640×480i)
- Custom modelines
- Interlaced output
- 15.7 kHz scanrates

This applies to both:
- **`amdgpu` and `radeon` drivers**
- **Discrete GPUs (dGPUs) and APUs**

🔗 A curated list of **supported AMD dGPUs and APUs using the AMDGPU driver** is available in the wiki:  
➡️ [Supported dGPUs & APUs](https://github.com/ZFEbHVUE/Batocera-CRT-Script/wiki/Supported-dGPUs-&-APUs)

---

### ❌ Intel iGPUs – **Not Supported**

All Intel integrated GPUs — across all generations — are **not compatible** with CRT output at 15kHz due to hardcoded limitations in the Intel DRM driver (`i915`):

- 🚫 **Minimum dotclock limits** (~25 MHz), 15kHz video modes
- 🚫 **Strict CVT/GTF-only modeline validation** (non-EDID custom modelines are rejected)
- 🚫 **No legacy CRTC interfaces** for timing control
- 🚫 **Tightly restricted DPLL clock generation**
- 🚫 **EDID dependency**, which prevents unsupported resolutions from loading

> ❗ These are **hardware and driver-level constraints**, not solvable with 15kHz patches. Intel iGPUs are **not supported** for CRT output in Batocera.

**Recommendation:** Use a supported AMD GPU or APU instead.

---

### ⚠️ NVIDIA GPUs – Limited and Fragile Support

#### ✅ Maxwell (1.0 – 2.0) via proprietary drivers
Batocera supports **NVIDIA Maxwell architecture** (GeForce GTX 750 through GTX 900 series) **only with the official NVIDIA proprietary drivers** for 15kHz CRT output.

> ℹ️ This is the **only NVIDIA setup officially supported**, and it works by chance — not by design.  
There is **no guarantee** future NVIDIA driver updates will preserve this compatibility.

🔗 A curated list of **supported NVIDIA Maxwell architecture** is available in the wiki:  
➡️ [Supported NVIDIA Maxwell Cards](https://github.com/ZFEbHVUE/Batocera-CRT-Script/wiki/Supported-NVIDIA-Maxwell-Cards-%28Proprietary-Driver%29)

#### ⚠️ Older cards using open-source `nouveau`
Some NVIDIA GPUs (pre-Maxwell) **may appear to work** with CRT output using the open-source `nouveau` driver, but:
- There is **no support from the 15kHz patchset**
- Success is **inconsistent**, and varies by card/BIOS.

> 🔧 These cards are **not recommended**, and any success is coincidental.

**Recommendation:** Go with AMD for proper CRT support and future-proofing.
We only provide official support for **NVIDIA Maxwell cards using proprietary drivers**, and even that may break at any time.
